# SudokuSolver
Sudoku Solver AI implementations with different algorithms.

In this project, we implemented various approaches to solve Sudoku as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem in Python. There are a total of 5 methods that students will implement:

Variable Selection Heuristics:
- Minimum Remaining Value (MRV)
- Minimum Remaining Value with Degree heuristic as a tie-breaker (MAD)
Value Selection Heuristics:
- Least Constraining Value (LCV)
Consistency Checks:
- Forward Checking (FC)
- Norvigâ€™s Check (NOR)
